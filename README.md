## What Problem Does Moovy Solve?

Most movie apps focus on either:

- raw databases with lots of information but little personalization, or  
- simple watchlists that are useful but passive.

Moovy explores a middle ground:  
**personalized discovery combined with social context.**

Instead of only tracking what users have watched, Moovy helps users:

- discover movies based on preferences and behavior,  
- organize films into meaningful watchlists,  
- explore what other people are watching or recommending.

## Core Features

### Smart Movie Discovery
Moovy uses AI-assisted search and recommendation logic to help users find movies aligned with their interests.

### Watchlists and Viewing History
Users can organize movies into custom watchlists, track what they have watched, and build a personal movie profile over time.

### Social Exploration
Moovy allows users to search for other users, explore shared interests, and discover movies through people as well as algorithms.

### Rich Movie Details
Each movie includes detailed information such as synopsis, cast and crew, ratings, and metadata.

### AI Search
An AI-powered search experience allows users to explore movies in a more natural and flexible way than traditional filters.

## Tech Stack

Moovy is built using a modern mobile stack with a focus on maintainability and developer experience:

- **React Native** for cross-platform mobile development  
- **TypeScript** for static typing and safer code  
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and consistent UI  
- **Figma** for UI and UX design

## Project Goals and Focus

Moovy is a fully functional mobile application, ready to use, though currently hosted on free-tier services.  

This means:

- The app works end-to-end for early users  
- There are some limitations in scalability and performance due to hosting constraints  
- With increased demand, the backend can be scaled and a proper costing model for users could be implemented  

The focus of this project has been on delivering a working, polished experience while balancing rapid development and usability. Moovy demonstrates:

- clean, scalable React Native architecture  
- responsive UI and smooth Android performance for a small user base  
- thoughtful UX around discovery and social interaction  
- potential for scaling and monetization if demand grows

---

## Current Status

Moovy is fully usable today and suitable for small-scale usage.  
Due to free hosting limitations, it is currently best suited for a handful of users, but the architecture allows scaling if demand increases.  

Future improvements may include:

- backend scaling and proper hosting costs for more users  
- deeper personalization and AI enhancements  
- expanded social features and performance optimizations
